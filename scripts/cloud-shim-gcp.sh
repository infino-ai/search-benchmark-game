# cloud-shim-aws.sh, and the two must keep the same contract:

#   BENCH_USER            unprivileged user the bench runs as
#   cloud_install_deps    OS packages + anything the distro needs
#   cloud_get  <name> <local>   fetch an object from the bench bucket
#   cloud_put  <local> <name>   upload an object to the bench bucket
#   cloud_signal <ok|error>     upload the run log, then publish the verdict
