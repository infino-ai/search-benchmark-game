"""Build a per-fork `/full`-style dashboard page for a branch bench run.

Usage:
    publish_branch_full.py \
        --main-full   results-full.json \
        --branch-full results-full-branch-<slug>.json \
        --template    web/build/full/index.html \
        --out-dir     web/build/<fork_user>/full \
        --label       "<repo>@<branch>"

A branch/fork run only benches infino-0.1. To make the published page a true
full-benchmark comparison (not a lone column), we splice the branch's infino
column into the committed main baseline — which already carries the competitor
engines and main's own infino — as a new engine `infino-0.1 @<branch>`. The page
then shows the branch side by side with tantivy, lucene, and main's infino.

The page reuses the prebuilt `/full` index.html verbatim (same JS bundle, which
fetches `./results.json` relative to the page URL). We only rewrite the static
asset paths for the extra directory depth and retitle the page so it is
self-identifying.
