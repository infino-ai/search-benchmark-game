"""What produced a results.json: the corpus, the queries, and when it ran.

A results file on its own says how fast each engine was and nothing about what
was measured. Two pages can differ because the corpus differs or because the
query set differs, and none of that was previously recorded anywhere.

One run, one answer: this is per-run metadata, not per-engine.

Nothing in here is allowed to fail a bench run. A run costs hours; this is a
label on it. Every lookup degrades to an absent field rather than raising, and
the page renders whatever is present.
